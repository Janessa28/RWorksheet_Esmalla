# 1.There is a built-in vector LETTERS contains the uppercase letters of the alphabet and letters which contains the lowercase letters of the alphabet.

# 1a. You need to produce a vector that contains the first 11 letters.
first_11_letters <- LETTERS[1:11]
first_11_letters

# 1b. Produce a vector that contains the odd numbered letters.
odd_numbered_letters <- LETTERS[seq(1, length(LETTERS), by = 2)]
odd_numbered_letters

# 1c. Produce a vector that contains the vowels
vowels <- LETTERS[LETTERS %in% c("A", "E", "I", "O", "U")]
vowels


# Based on the above vector letters:

lower_Alphabet <- letters[1:26]
lower_Alphabet

# 1d. Produce a vector that contains the last 5 lowercase letters.
last_five_let <- letters[22:26]
last_five_let

# 1e. Produce a vector that contains letters between 15 to 24 letters in lowercase.
letters_15_to_24 <- letters[15:24]
letters_15_to_24

# 2. Create a vector(not a dataframe) with the average temperatures in April for Tugue-garao City, Manila, Iloilo City, Tacloban, Samal Island, and Davao City. The average temperatures in Celcius are 42, 39, 34, 34, 30, and 27 degrees.

# 2a. What is the R code and its result for creating a character vector for the city/town of Tuguegarao City, Manila, Iloilo City, Tacloban,Samal Island, and Davao City? Name the object as city. The names should follow the same order as in the instruction 
city <- c("Tuguegarao City", "Manila", "Iloilo City", "Tacloban", "Samal Island", "Davao City")

# 2b. The average temperatures in Celcius are 42, 39, 34, 34, 30, and 27 degrees.Name the object as temp.
temp <- c(42, 39, 34, 34, 30, 27)

# 2c. Create a dataframe to combine the city and the temp by using â€˜data.frame(). What the R code and its result?
data_temp <- data.frame(City = city, Temperature = temp)

# 2d. Associate the dataframe you have created in 2.(c) by naming the columns using the names() function. Change the column names by using names() function as City and Temperature.
names(data_temp) <- c("City", "Temperature")
names(data_temp)

# 2e. Print the structure by using str() function. Describe the output.
str(data_temp)

# 2f. From the answer in d, what is the content of row 3 and row 4 What is its R code and its output?
row_temp <- data_temp[3:4, ]
